- Apply the YAML file to deploy elasticsearch

`oc create -f 2_deploy_elasticsearch.yaml`{{execute}}

- To make elasticsearch persistent we just need callout OCS PVC under ``volumes`` section and mount it under ``volumeMounts`` inside the deplooyment manifest file, as shown below. Doing this, elasticsearch will then store all of its data on the the PVC which resides on OpenShift Container Storage.
  
```
...
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: ocs-pv-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: ocs-pv-claim
...
...
...
        volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: "/usr/share/elasticsearch/data"
            name: ocs-pv-storage         
```
> As a developer you have nothing to care about beyond this point for data persistence. OpenShift Container Storage make sure your application's data is persistent and reliably stored under storage subsystem.
