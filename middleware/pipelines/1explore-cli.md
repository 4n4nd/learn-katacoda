##Â Install Tekton Operator

OpenShift Pipelines is provided as an OpenShift add-on that can be installed via an
operator that is available in the OpenShift OperatorHub.

Operators may be installed into a single namespace and only monitor resources in that
namespace, but the OpenShift Pipelines Operator installs globally on the cluster and monitors
and manage pipelines for every single user in the cluster.

To install the operator globally, you need to be a cluster administrator user. In this workshop environment,
the operator has already been installed for you.



That's it!

In the next step, we'll get started with creating your first project using the **web console**.
