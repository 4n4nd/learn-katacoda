Let's get started with the OpenShift web console.

To begin, click on the **Dashboard** link in the console frame. This will open the web console link in another window.

You should see an **OpenShift Origin** window with **Username** and **Password** forms, similar to this one:

For this scenario, start by entering the following:

**Username:** `developer`

**Password:** `developer`

After logging in to the web console, you'll see a button labeled: **New Project**. Click this to get started.

You should now see a page for creating your first project in web console. Fill it in with the following:
>New project

>** *Name **

>`myproject`

The rest is optional and up to you. Be careful with all of that responsibility.

After your project is created, you'll be taken to a screen where you can begin adding content to your project.
